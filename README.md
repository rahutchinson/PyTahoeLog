# PyTahoeLog
Tahoe is getting old and having problems. Figured I would start collecting some data for some preventative maintenence.

# REVIVE
pulling this from the grave and putting it up on some undecided thing with GCP

## Tasks
	- Interface on Tahoe
	- Connection solution
	- Dashboard to see data
	- BS some AI to try to find some correlations?
